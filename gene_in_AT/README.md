the goal is to create a table, and a plot with all of following inofrmations for ou 6 strains :
- number of gene in AT rich regions
- genome length
- AT rich regions length
- Other CG regions length ( calculate in result sheet with other CG = genome length â€“ (gene length + At-rich length)

This sheet table is convert in long format to create the plot visualization
